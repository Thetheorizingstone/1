#To extend the recursive model and incorporate market collapse, disease containment, population decline, real-time energy usage metrics, and demand-side supply chain requirements, we can build upon the recursive exponentiation framework by adding specific real-time feedback loops and threshold conditions that account for decline or containment.

#Hereâ€™s how we can define and implement these features:

#1. Market Collapse Model:

#For market collapse, we modify the recursive growth model to include a feedback mechanism where rapid growth is followed by an abrupt crash once certain thresholds are crossed (such as over-leverage or investor panic).

#Recursive Decline: Add a threshold CRASH_THRESHOLD that, when met or exceeded, initiates a recursive decline.

#Value Decay: Implement a DECAY_FACTOR that simulates market value shrinking, rather than growing, after a collapse.


#Example Pseudocode:

def market_collapse(x, depth=1):
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        return None
    
    prev = x
    next_val = x ** prev

    # Check if crash threshold is exceeded
    if next_val > CRASH_THRESHOLD:
        next_val = next_val * DECAY_FACTOR
    
    if abs(next_val - prev) < DELTA:
        return next_val
    else:
        return market_collapse(next_val, depth + 1)

#2. Disease Containment:

#For disease containment, the recursive model can simulate outbreak escalation and containment measures. A containment factor can be introduced based on interventions such as vaccination or social distancing, which reduce the reproduction rate after certain thresholds.

#Containment Factor: Introduce a CONTAINMENT_FACTOR that reduces growth when a containment policy is triggered.

#Threshold for Containment: After a certain number of iterations (e.g., based on infection spread), the CONTAINMENT_FACTOR will slow the recursion.


#Example Pseudocode:

def disease_outbreak(x, depth=1):
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        return None

    prev = x
    next_val = x ** prev
    
    # Apply containment measures
    if next_val > OUTBREAK_THRESHOLD:
        next_val = next_val * CONTAINMENT_FACTOR
    
    if abs(next_val - prev) < DELTA:
        return next_val
    else:
        return disease_outbreak(next_val, depth + 1)

#3. Population Decline:

#For population decline, we can create a model where the population starts decreasing after certain negative feedback loops take effect (e.g., resource shortages or environmental collapse).

#Decline Factor: Introduce a DECLINE_FACTOR that initiates when negative growth triggers population loss.


#Example Pseudocode:

def population_decline(x, depth=1):
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        return None
    
    prev = x
    next_val = x ** prev

    # Apply population decline logic
    if next_val < MIN_POPULATION_THRESHOLD:
        next_val = next_val * DECLINE_FACTOR
    
    if abs(next_val - prev) < DELTA:
        return next_val
    else:
        return population_decline(next_val, depth + 1)

#4. Real-Time Energy Usage Metrics:

#For energy usage, the model can dynamically adjust for fluctuating demand and supply conditions. Recursive feedback loops can simulate energy consumption increases, while energy efficiency measures or renewable energy adoption can reduce the rate of growth.

#Energy Usage Function: A recursive growth in energy demand (ENERGY_GROWTH_FACTOR) can be combined with an efficiency factor (EFFICIENCY_FACTOR) to reduce energy usage over time.


#Example Pseudocode:

def energy_usage(x, depth=1):
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        return None
    
    prev = x
    next_val = x ** prev

    # Apply energy efficiency logic
    next_val = next_val * EFFICIENCY_FACTOR
    
    if abs(next_val - prev) < DELTA:
        return next_val
    else:
        return energy_usage(next_val, depth + 1)

#5. Demand-Side Supply Chain Requirements:

#For supply chain demand, recursive models can track demand-side shocks and adjust for changes in inventory and logistics constraints. As demand grows, recursive calculations can determine when supply chain bottlenecks emerge, and introduce delays or costs.

#Supply Chain Bottleneck: Introduce a BOTTLENECK_THRESHOLD that simulates delays or capacity issues once demand exceeds certain levels.

#Inventory Adjustment: Reduce the output based on available inventory when demand exceeds supply.


#Example Pseudocode:

def supply_chain_demand(x, depth=1):
    if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH:
        return None
    
    prev = x
    next_val = x ** prev

    # Check if bottleneck threshold is exceeded
    if next_val > BOTTLENECK_THRESHOLD:
        next_val = next_val * BOTTLENECK_FACTOR
    
    if abs(next_val - prev) < DELTA:
        return next_val
    else:
        return supply_chain_demand(next_val, depth + 1)
