accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Decision Tree Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

20. Linear Programming for Resource Optimization

	•	Industry Example: Manufacturing – Optimizing production to maximize profit given resource constraints.

from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Objective: Maximize profit for two products (maximize: 3x + 5y)
c = [-3, -5]  # Coefficients (negative for maximization)

# Constraints: Resource limits
# 2x + y <= 100
# x + y <= 80
A = [[2, 1], [1, 1]]
b = [100, 80]

# Bounds for x and y (cannot produce negative units)
x_bounds = (0, None)
y_bounds = (0, None)

# Solve linear program
result = linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method="simplex")

# Print optimal solution
print(f"Optimal production levels:\nProduct 1: {result.x[0]:.2f}\nProduct 2: {result.x[1]:.2f}")
print(f"Maximum Profit: {-result.fun:.2f}")

Math Explanation:
Linear programming optimizes a linear objective function subject to linear constraints. Here, we maximize  3x + 5y  with constraints:
\[
\begin{align*}
2x + y & \leq 100, \\
x + y & \leq 80.
\end{align*}
\]

# Apply K-Means clustering with 3 clusters
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(data)

plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c=clusters, cmap='viridis')
plt.title("Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering")
plt.xlabel("Purchase Amount")
plt.ylabel("Visits per Month")
plt.show()

Math Explanation:
K-Means minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and updating the center. Each data point belongs to the cluster with the minimum distance from its centroid:

\text{minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \| x - \mu_i \|^2

            self.position += 1
        elif action == -1:  # Move backward
            self.position -= 1
        return self.position, self.reward()

    def reward(self):
        return 1 if self.position == 10 else -0.1

# Simple Q-learning algorithm
q_table = np.zeros((20, 2))  # 20 states, 2 actions (forward, backward)
learning_rate = 0.1
discount_factor = 0.9

env = SimpleEnvironment()
for episode in range(100):
    state = env.position
    for step in range(50):
        action = np.argmax(q_table[state])  # Choose best action
        next_state, reward = env.step(action)
        q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] + learning_rate * (
            reward + discount_factor * np.max(q_table[next_state]) - q_table[state, action]
        )
        state = next_state

Math Explanation:
Q-learning updates the Q-values (expected rewards for actions at states) using the Bellman Equation:

Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_a Q(s{\prime}, a) - Q(s, a) \right)

Where:

	•	 \alpha : Learning rate.

    denominator = numerator + false_positive_rate * (1 - prior)
    return numerator / denominator

posterior = bayes_theorem(prior, sensitivity, false_positive_rate)
print(f"Posterior Probability of Disease: {posterior:.2f}")

Math Explanation:
Bayes’ theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence:

P(\text{Disease}|\text{Positive}) = \frac{P(\text{Positive}|\text{Disease}) \cdot P(\text{Disease})}{P(\text{Positive})}

Where  P(\text{Positive})  is calculated as:

P(\text{Positive}) = P(\text{Positive}|\text{Disease}) \cdot P(\text{Disease}) + P(\text{Positive}|\text{No Disease}) \cdot P(\text{No Disease})

42. Text Summarization using Transformers

	•	Industry Example: Media – Automatically summarizing news articles for quick consumption.

from transformers import pipeline

# Use Hugging Face's Transformers for text summarization
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")

# Sample text for summarization
text = "Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing many fields. The recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing have allowed AI systems to outperform humans in certain tasks."

# Summarize text
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=30, min_length=10, do_sample=False)

    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Apply Factor Analysis
factor_model = FactorAnalysis(n_components=2)
factors = factor_model.fit_transform(data)
print(factors[:5])  # Show the first 5 factor scores

Math Explanation:

45. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for Signal Analysis

	•	Industry Example: Engineering – Analyzing sound signals for frequency components.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a signal with multiple frequencies
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 500)
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 50 * t) + np.sin(2 * np.pi * 120 * t)

# Compute DFT
dft = np.fft.fft(signal)
frequencies = np.fft.fftfreq(len(t), d=t[1] - t[0])

# Plot the magnitude of frequencies
plt.plot(frequencies[:len(frequencies)//2], np.abs(dft)[:len(dft)//2])
plt.title("Frequency Components")
plt.xlabel("Frequency (Hz)")
plt.ylabel("Magnitude")
plt.show()

Math Explanation:
The DFT transforms a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, representing it as a sum of sinusoidal components:

X(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) \cdot e^{-j 2 \pi k n / N}

where  X(k)  represents the frequency component of the signal.

exploration_rate = 0.1

# Q-learning example
for episode in range(1000):
    state = np.random.randint(0, states)
    for step in range(10):
        if np.random.rand() < exploration_rate:
            action = np.random.randint(0, actions)
        else:
            action = np.argmax(q_table[state])
        reward = np.random.rand()
        next_state = np.random.randint(0, states)
        q_table[state, action] = q_table[state, action] + learning_rate * (

        )
        state = next_state

print("Learned Q-table:", q_table)

Math Explanation:
Q-Learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that updates a Q-value table using the Bellman Equation:

Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_a Q(s{\prime}, a) - Q(s, a) \right)

where  \alpha  is the learning rate,  \gamma  is the discount factor, and  r  is the reward.

Math Explanation:
Association rule mining identifies frequent itemsets in transactions and uncovers rules of the form:

\text{Confidence}(A \rightarrow B) = \frac{\text{Support}(A \cup B)}{\text{Support}(A)}


	•	Support: How often an itemset appears in transactions.
