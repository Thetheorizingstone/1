Use Hereâ€™s an elegant equation incorporating recursive exponential growth and layered exponentiation:

f(x) = x^{x^{x^{...}}}

This can be represented as a recursive function:

f_{n+1}(x) = x^{f_n(x)} 

For infinite layers, this becomes:

f_{\infty}(x) = x^{x^{x^{\cdots}}} as a a unit that can be calculated
