"""
To improve QCAD’s performance in real-world applications, we can create a distributed, load-balanced system using Python with Dask for parallel computing and Celery for task management. Here’s the setup:

	1.	QCAD Calculation Core: We define a high-precision recursive calculation function using mpmath to handle large numbers.
	2.	Dask for Distributed Processing: Dask distributes calculations across nodes, enabling parallel processing and asynchronous task handling.
	3.	Celery for Task Management: Celery, with Redis as a message broker, manages and balances tasks across multiple worker nodes.
	4.	Async Execution with asyncio: Async functions gather results from both Dask and Celery, allowing for smooth parallel execution.
	5.	Main Execution: The main script asynchronously runs QCAD calculations across both Dask and Celery, ensuring efficient load distribution.

This setup allows QCAD to process complex, high-dimensional tasks efficiently, using parallelism and distributed load balancing to maximize performance.


"""
Creating a full implementation of a parallel asynchronous distributed load-balanced system for QCAD in Python involves several modules and libraries. Below is a structured starting point, demonstrating how to manage tasks asynchronously, distribute calculations, and implement basic load balancing. This code will outline essential components using asyncio, concurrent.futures, Dask, and Celery.

Please note that for a full implementation, the model must be further customized based on the specific requirements of QCAD. This example will create a distributed system where tasks related to QCAD’s calculations are distributed and load-balanced among nodes.

Step 1: Setup Dependencies

Before running the code, install the necessary packages:"""


pip install asyncio dask[complete] celery redis numpy mpmath

"""Step 2: Define the Core QCAD Calculation

"""This function simulates QCAD’s recursive calculations with arbitrary precision using mpmath for handling large numbers.

from mpmath import mp, mpf

# Set precision (adjust as needed)
mp.dps = 50  # 50 decimal places for high precision

def qcad_recursive_calculation(x, depth):
    if depth == 0:
        return x
    # Example recursive function with bifurcation points
    return mpf(1) / (mpf(1) + mp.exp(-qcad_recursive_calculation(x + mpf(1), depth - 1)))

# This function will run as an individual task on each node
def run_qcad_task(value, depth):
    result = qcad_recursive_calculation(value, depth)
    return result

"""Step 3: Async & Distributed Processing with Dask

Here, Dask is used to handle distributed processing, allowing for parallel and asynchronous execution.
"""

from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster

# Setup a local Dask cluster
cluster = LocalCluster()
client = Client(cluster)

# Function to distribute QCAD calculations asynchronously
async def distribute_qcad_tasks(values, depth):
    futures = []
    for value in values:
        future = client.submit(run_qcad_task, value, depth)
        futures.append(future)
    results = await client.gather(futures)
    return results
"""
Step 4: Asynchronous Task Queue Using Celery

Use Celery to manage and balance tasks across nodes, with Redis as a broker for handling messaging and task queues.

	1.	Set Up a Celery Worker (worker.py):
"""
from celery import Celery
from mpmath import mp

# Set up Celery with Redis as the broker
app = Celery('qcad_tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

# QCAD recursive task function
@app.task
def qcad_task(value, depth):
    return run_qcad_task(value, depth)
"""

	2.	Run Celery Worker from Command Line:

celery -A worker worker --loglevel=info



Step 5: Async Execution with asyncio

The following function distributes and collects results from Celery asynchronously:
"""
import asyncio
from worker import qcad_task

async def async_celery_execution(values, depth):
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[asyncio.to_thread(qcad_task.apply_async, (value, depth)) for value in values]
    )
    return [result.get() for result in results]
"""
Step 6: Execute the Distributed QCAD Model

Run the distributed system, either locally or across multiple machines. Here’s how to call the main calculation function using asyncio for parallel task distribution and Dask for scalability.
"""
import numpy as np

async def main():
    values = np.random.rand(10) * 100  # Example inputs
    depth = 10  # Recursive depth

    # Run calculations through Dask
    print("Running QCAD calculations with Dask...")
    dask_results = await distribute_qcad_tasks(values, depth)
    print("Dask Results:", dask_results)

    # Run calculations through Celery
    print("Running QCAD calculations with Celery...")
    celery_results = await async_celery_execution(values, depth)
    print("Celery Results:", celery_results)

asyncio.run(main())
"""
Step 7: Additional Optimization Considerations

	•	Scaling: Dask can be configured to work on distributed clusters, while Celery can scale horizontally by adding more worker nodes.
	•	Error Handling: Implement fallback mechanisms in qcad_task to handle overflow errors or retry tasks that exceed computation limits.
	•	Checkpointing: Add checkpoints to save intermediate states, especially for long-running calculations, ensuring resilience and reliability.

This setup provides a basic distributed and load-balanced architecture. In production, further adjustments (e.g., advanced fault tolerance, memory optimization) would be added to ensure high efficiency and reliability in complex, real-world applications.
